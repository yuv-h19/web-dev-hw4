## 📁 Project Structure

* **index.html** – The primary structure of the calculator, utilizing Semantic HTML5 structural tags to define the page hierarchy. It includes a form equipped with an `onsubmit` event listener for validation.
* **calcstyle.css** – Custom styling that applies CSS Positioning and Box Model principles. It utilizes absolute positioning to create custom selection labels and Flexbox for aligned input groups.
* **script.js** – The client-side logic engine. It manages interactivity by responding to user events, performing conditional logic, and interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM).
